JavaTea looks for a JRE installed in JAVATEA_HOME/lib/java/.
  (Reason: while Radford's server lets scripts run system('java'),
   there was no system('javac').)

To install on rucs:
  (both rucs and php are Xeon E54xx)

cd ~/dynamic_php/JavaTea/lib
# find the real dir to copy:
ls -l /usr/local/java  

rsync -a /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.24 .
mv java-6-sun-1.6.0.24 java

# Now, resolve a file that was a non-local link:
rm  ./java/jre/lib/i386/jvm.cfg
cp  /etc/java-6-sun/jvm.cfg   ./java/jre/lib/i386/jvm.cfg
