JavaTea looks for a JRE installed in JAVATEA_HOME/lib/java/.
  (Reason: while Radford's server lets scripts run system('java'),
   there was no system('javac').)

To install rucs:

rsync -a /usr/local/java/ ./java/
# Now, resolve a file that was a non-local link:
rm  ./java/jre/lib/i386/jvm.cfg
cp  /etc/java-6-sun/jvm.cfg   ./java/jre/lib/i386/jvm.cfg
