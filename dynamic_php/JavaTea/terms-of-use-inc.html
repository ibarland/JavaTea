    The &ldquo;Teacher E-mail&rdquo; you designate will 
    be able to view you the work you submit on this site.
    (You may leave it blank, but of course then
     nobody else will be able to confirm that you completed any of your work.)
    </li>

    <li>
      If your teacher is also working with the JavaTea site administrators,
      your information might also be correlated 
      with your overall course performance 
      and shared with the site administrators with
      for improvement of both JavaTea and the course.
      This aggregate information (not traceable to individuals) might be
      used for published works.
      <p>
      If you don't want your teacher to share your course performance
      with the JavaTea site administrators, please let them know.
      </p>

    <li>
    If your e-mail is not actually a valid email, you can still use the system
    but you will be unable to reset your password
    (since the new password will be sent to that email.)
    <br/>
    Note that this means that if you mis-type your username and forget the mis-typing,
    we'll not be able to retrieve your previous work!
    </li>

    <li>
     JavaTea stores the e-mail addresses and associated work under that e-mail,
      but does not gather/store IP addresses.
      The site may record which browsers and OSs people use to access the site,
      but this will not be correlated with individual e-mails or users.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will not try to attack the JavaTea website by any means,
      including inserting information designed to break or break into the JavaTea system
      or compromise any other user's information.
      If it does appear you have intentionally done so,
      this information may be shared with the Teacher E-mail you provide,
      faculty or administrators at your school, 
      and/or any other pertinent parties.
    </li>
    </ul>
