x equality test: allow for .equals

- add new problems

x add better bug_ versions, for existing problems.

x godaddy/enom/google-sites: stop the frame'ing

+ compile to a file depending on session name (or username, if logged in, or random?) 

+ investigate the timing

- what to do about the 'duplicate' icon on home page?

- fix up all the "***" in probs-inc.php

- factor out the repeated equality-test (only two choices)

- connect to db

- wrap the *generated* code in try/catch (so that implementations don't have to worry)

- on mouseover of 'fail', show the failed result.

- add problem-sets

- add "tool"tips about including quotes, for string-probs

- add "tool"tips about allowing expressions, for numerics

       Another approach: all variables are actually object-attributes.
