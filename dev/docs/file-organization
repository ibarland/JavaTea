~itec120/src/JavaTea : git repo
~itec120/{dynamic_php,public_html} are live (and have other files besides JavaTea);
~itec120/{dynamic_php,public_html}/JavaTea will have the live application (only our files);
~itec120/src/JavaTea/{dynamic_php,public_html}/JavaTea/ has our working code base.
    "make install" (at the repo root) will push the changes live from any machine.


web@,php@ are symlinks for convenience; do not use them.
  (Also: note that Makefile currently uses scp to install files, 
   and scp will follow symbolic links, yikes. So don't make symlinks
   inside our directory -- or at least, we'll have to change the Makefile
   to use something like tar or pax instead of scp.)
Also, ~itec120/jt@.

Most of the previous files (php-ish) are just moved into repo:dynamic_php/.



(Note: I deleted forgot.php; moved header.php to templates/header2.inc.php)
