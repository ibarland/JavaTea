- purchase the domain name "coolsite.org" through googleapps, $10/yr
   (This initially hosts the site at googleapps, which provides management tools.)

- go to the google apps control panel for your site.
       https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/coolsite.org/
    If you forget the name of the site, it's roundabout to find it:
       coolsite.org > login > other... > manage  .... .... ...




- The actual domain-name registration is being done by a third-part company
    (godaddy.com is the default as of 2010.Aug).
    Let's figure out your godaddy.com account and password:

   http://www.steegle.com/websites/google-sites-howtos/googlesites-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaq#TOC-Where-do-I-go-to-Edit-my-Google-App

- log in to the godaddy admin page.
  Note that you can't just go to "godaddy.com" -- you have to click on
  the google-apps page which gave you your login,passwd above

- Manage Domains > Domains > Domain Information > Forwarding > Manage;
  You can enter the destination URL; 
   also click "Advanced options" and choose "masking"

Not working.   I'll try removing all A/Cname entries.
Currently the A entries are "@" to 216.239.{30,32,34,36}.21
  When I use 'reset to default entries, those are different: 64.233.179.121, ...)
and CNAME entries are {calendar,docs,mail,start,www} to ghs.google.com

I also re-pressed Set Nameservers > I want to forward my domains

Perhaps an "A" record needs to be set to godaddy's domain-name server:
 as per first comment on:

------------
 [ several other failed attempts: changing an A record to nw0{2,3,4}.domaincontrol.com ]
 
  I tried instead setting 'forward (temporary)' (w/o masking); 
    this caused A record 64.202.189.170 to be added (since I had the
    'update my DNS settings to support this change' checked);
    but it didn't work until I removed the *old* A records.

Try getting help at forums?:

I deleted the SRV records (all for _jabber and _xmpp-server -- both
dealing with instant-messaging and setting your 'online presence').
They had been:
  service: {_jabber,_xmpp-server}; protocol: _tcp; name: @; 
  priority: {5,20}; weight: 0; port: 5269; target: xmpp-server{,{1,2,3,4}}.L.google.com
